# üìù User Scripts Collection üìù

This repository is a collection of scripts I've created to enhance the user experience on several websites I frequently visit. Initially, I was using Tampermonkey for script management, but I've since migrated to Violentmonkey.

Here's a brief description of what each script does:

- **NovelOnlineFreeSimplifierFixer**: This script simplifies the user interface and removes white-colored elements on NovelOnlineFree, optimizing it for a more comfortable night reading experience. Although the website had previously fixed a major issue with line indenting, as of 2018/06/01, the script retains its original functionality, albeit disabled by default.

- **PoeLogDownloader**: This script enables you to download Path of Exile (PoE) chat logs. Please note that you need to manually scroll back through the chat history to load all the messages prior to initiating the download.

In the words of an ancient philosopher, "Nothingness is the only true eternal goal".
